# ðŸš€ 30-Day Array Problem-Solving Challenge (JavaScript)

Welcome to the **30-Day Array Problem-Solving Plan**!  
This roadmap takes you from **absolute basics** of arrays to **advanced interview-level problems**.  
By the end, youâ€™ll have solved **100+ problems** and built strong problem-solving logic.

## ðŸ›  How to Practice
1. Use **JavaScript** (`for`, `while`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc.).
2. Start with **brute force** â†’ then optimize.
3. Write **dry runs** on paper before coding.
4. Push solutions daily to GitHub for tracking.
5. After 30 days â†’ focus on **mock interviews**.

---

## âš¡ Outcome
âœ… Mastered **100+ array problems**.  
âœ… Strong base for **DSA + Frontend interviews**.  
âœ… Ready for companies like **Litmus7, Infosys, Accenture, Product-based firms**.
